# Data Science Projects

This repository includes multiple data science projects.

## Real Estate Analysis
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

This is Kaggle's competition: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview), and I rank top 35% on this project.

## Movie Sentiment Analysis
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of movie reviews, aimed at determining the underlying sentiment expressed within a body of text. By analyzing the content of movie reviews, we strive to classify each review as positive or negative automatically.

## Insurance Analysis

These datasets feature a unique label assigning a Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) score to clients who have purchased insurance derived from various factors.
