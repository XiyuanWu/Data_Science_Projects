**Movie Sentiment Analysis: Review Polarity Classification**


## Background

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of movie reviews, aimed at determining the underlying sentiment expressed within a body of text. By analyzing the content of movie reviews, we strive to classify each review as positive or negative automatically. 

Dataset can be found in [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).

## Result & Conclusion

Our model achieved the following performance metrics:

- Accuracy: 0.8782
- Precision: 0.8683
- Recall: 0.8890
- F1 Score: 0.8786
- ROC AUC: 0.9477

These results indicate a strong overall performance. Given the constraints on GPU resources, we were unable to conduct hyperparameter tuning. However, it's plausible that with further optimization, we could see an improvement in these scores.
