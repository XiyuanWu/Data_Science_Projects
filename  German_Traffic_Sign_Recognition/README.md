#  German Traffic Sign Recognition

## Background

The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. We cordially invite researchers from relevant fields to participate: The competition is designed to allow for participation without special domain knowledge. Our benchmark has the following properties:

- Single-image, multi-class classification problem
- More than 40 classes
- More than 50,000 images in total
- Large, lifelike database

Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign).

## Conclusion

This model get 96.5% accuracy and loss of 0.29 on test set.
