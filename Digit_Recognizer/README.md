# Digit Recognizer

## Background

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. We’ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.

**Update**

I have added a fixed version that gets accuracy and loss on test data when split dataset. Unfortunately, it doesn't matter how I run; it seems impossible to get 100% accuracy in the training set anymore, and that version gets the highest score on Kaggle. And I decided to keep both for reference.

## Conclusion

The model achieved the following performance metrics: 
- Train Accuracy: 100%
- Train Loss: 1.3044e-06
- Val Accuracy: 99.26%
- Val Loss: 0.0528

On fix notebook:
- Test Accuracy: 98.88%
- Test Loss: 0.0902
